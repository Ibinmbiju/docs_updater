The leading `0` indicates the SDK is still evolving rapidly. Increment the components as follows:\n\n## Minor ( `Y`) versions\n\nWe will increase minor versions `Y` for **breaking changes** to any public interfaces that are not marked as beta. For example, going from `0.0.x` to `0.1.x` might include breaking changes.\n\nIf you don't want breaking changes, we recommend pinning to `0.0.x` versions in your project.\n\n## Patch ( `Z`) versions\n\nWe will increment `Z` for non-breaking changes:\n\n- Bug fixes\n- New features\n- Changes to private interfaces\n- Updates to beta features",
